Understanding How a System/Program Works 

3. Think about an information system you frequently interact with (e.g. at the ATM, the online Portal, at the airport etc.)
   - Identify at least ONE function the system allows you to carry out.
   - What are some of the inputs you make to the system?
   - What are some of the processing functions that take place (e.g. what does the program attempt to calculate/do)?
   - What are some of the outputs displayed/presented based on what was processed?
   - Explain how you think the system could have been developed using the systems development life cycle. Give specific examples for each phase.
     Who are some of the persons primarily responsible for carrying out each of these phases?
   - Using one of the functions previously identified, explain how you think the Program Development Cycle would have applied to the development of that program.
     Who are the persons primarily responsible for carrying out the program development?
   - Differentiate between the users and the developers/programmers of this system. Going back to the function you identified,
     what are some of the areas that the programmers would be able to see/have access to that the users would not see/know? 
4. Is input required for all programs? Why or why not?
5. Write a program that prints “Hello” onto the screen.
6. Write a program that finds and displays the product of 250 and 45.
7. Write a program that prompts the user for two numbers, then finds and displays their product.
   a. What input, processing, and output are required?
8. You go to the supermarket with $1000 to buy an item. GCT, calculated at 17.5% is applicable to the item.
   Write a program to prompt the cashier to enter the item cost (assume a valid amount is provided),
   then determine and output the GCT amount and the change from the $1000.
   a. What input, processing, and output are required?
   b. How would your program change if you did not know the amount of money being submitted for payment of the item?
