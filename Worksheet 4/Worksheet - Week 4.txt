Design the pseudocode for all the following (where applicable). In your lab session, use Microsoft Visio to prepare the flowchart.
1. Write a program that accepts a value for num1 and prints “true” if num1 is divisible by 7 AND if num1 is an even number. Otherwise it prints nothing.
2. Write a program that accepts a value for num1 and prints “true” if num1 is divisible by 7 OR if num1 is an even number. Otherwise it prints “not true”.
3. Design a program that will examine the value of an integer variable called investType and print one of the following messages, depending on the value assigned to investType.
   (a) “Stocks”, if investType is 1
   (b) “Bonds”, if investType is 2
   (c) “Mutual Funds”, if investType is 3
   (d) “Invalid”, if investType has any other value
   Use a sequential if and a nested if structure (two separate designs) and clearly explain the difference between the two structures.
4. Write the pseudocode corresponding to the following flowchart: (check folder for flowchart image).
5. Design a program that will prompt the user for the price of an article and a pricing code.  Your program is then to calculate a discount according to the pricing code 
   and print to the screen the original price of the article, the discount amount and the new discounted price.  Calculate the pricing code and accompanying discount amount as follows: 
            Pricing Code                  Discount Rate
                H                              50%
                F                              40%
                T                              33%
                Q                              25%
                Z                              0%
   If the pricing code is Z, the words “No Discount!!” are to be displayed on the screen.  If the pricing code is not H, F, T Q or Z, the words “INVALID PRICING CODE” are to be displayed.
   Select the most appropriate structure (nested- if or sequential-if) to use for your design.
6. Effective July 2016, the new income tax threshold and tax rate moved to the following:
              Income ($)                 Rate of Tax (%)
              0 - 796,536                      0
          > 796,536 - 6,000,000                25
            Above 6,000,000                    30
Design a program that will prompt for a person’s salary and calculate and display the income tax and net income.
7. Design the pseudocode and flowchart for a program that will accept the total amount due and existing loyalty points on a customer’s supermarket bill.
   The program should then determine the number of loyalty points s/he will receive for this bill according to the table below, and update the points for the customer.  
                  Bill Amount                                        Loyalty Points
            Up to and including $5000                                       6
    More than $5000 and less than and including $15000                      10
                More than $15000                                            15
   If the customer’s new loyalty points exceed 100, prompt for whether the customer would like to redeem the loyalty points. Redeeming the points result in a 3% discount on the bill and a zeroing of the loyalty 
   points. If this is the case, output the discount amount and the new bill balance. Thereafter, the program should output the updated loyalty points.

8. Using the guidelines located at the link below for the determination of a Jamaican employee’s salary, write a program that will input the gross pay for the month and determine and output all related taxes and other 
   fields. Assume the employee is making a 5% contribution to pension. https://www.jamaicatax.gov.jm/documents/10181/106865/payroll_and_contribution_rates_employers.pdf/4ddb3ffd-597b-4fa4-a17c-bde7968ac738.
   Use the applicable 2016 (July to December) value for the income tax threshold located at https://www.jamaicatax.gov.jm/home/-/blogs/income-tax-threshold-to-be-increased-effective-july-1-2016 to determine the salary.
