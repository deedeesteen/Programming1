4. Design a program that prompts for the radius of a circle, then determine and display the circle’s diameter, area, and circumference.
5. Design a program that will calculate the profit (selling price – cost price) made on an item, given the cost price and the selling price.
   Assume that the selling price is greater than the cost price. Express the profit in percentage form.
6. Design a program that will prompt the user to enter a person’s weight (in pounds) and height (in inches).
   The program should then determine and display the person’s body mass index (BMI) given the following: 
                    BMI = weight/height^2 * 703
7. Design a program that will determine the weighted coursework grade for a module that has a 60% coursework component.
   The weighting for the three coursework components is 20%, 15%, and 25%. Your program should accept the numerical grades achieved for each
   component and display the weighted coursework grade in an attractive format.

Let's Get Real!
Simulate the processing of the charges of a water bill (see image in folder) by: 
• accepting the present and previous consumption amounts in litres
• determining and displaying the actual consumption amount
• accepting the previous bill balance and payment
• determining and displaying any overdue amount
• multiplying the consumption times the rate to get the water charges
• calculating the sewage charges (100% of water charges)
• determining and displaying the total charges

A Little More Challenging!
Design a program that accepts the profit (in percentage) made by a business, as well as the actual profit (in dollars).
Determine and output the business’ total costs and total sales. 
E.g. 
Profit in percentage: 20 
Actual profit: 25000 
Total Costs = $125000 
Total Sales = $150000.
